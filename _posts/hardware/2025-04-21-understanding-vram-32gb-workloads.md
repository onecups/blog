### üì¶ What Is VRAM?

**VRAM (Video RAM)** is a special type of memory used by your GPU to store textures, frame buffers, and other graphics data. Unlike system RAM, VRAM is optimized for fast, high-bandwidth operations that are crucial in visual workloads.

### üß† Why 32GB VRAM Matters

| Creative Task           | Ideal VRAM             | Reason                                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 8K Video Editing        | 24‚Äì32GB                | Large frame buffers & raw footage caching |
| 3D Modeling & Rendering | 16‚Äì32GB                | Complex geometry & high-res textures     |
| Machine Learning        | 24‚Äì48GB                | Model weights, tensor ops in memory      |
| Game Development        | 12‚Äì32GB                | Multiple high-resolution assets          |
| Virtual Production      | 32GB+                  | Real-time rendering and VFX pipelines    |

### üîç Common Bottlenecks Without Enough VRAM

- App crashes or freezes during renders
- Lower quality previews or proxy workflows
- Slower timeline playback in DaVinci Resolve or Premiere Pro
- Inability to load large 3D scenes
- Constant system RAM swapping (hurts performance)

---

### ‚úÖ When You *Need* 32GB of VRAM

You should seriously consider a GPU with 32GB+ VRAM if:

- You're handling **RAW footage at 6K/8K resolutions**
- Your scenes exceed **10M+ polygons** or use **8K textures**
- You're training **AI models on-device**
- You rely on **real-time compositing** or **multi-layer VFX**
